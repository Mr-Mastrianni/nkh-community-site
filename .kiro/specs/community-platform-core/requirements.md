# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Community Platform Core is a foundational component of the Nefer Kali Healing website that enables users to connect, interact, and share their spiritual journeys. This feature will transform the website from a static information portal into a dynamic spiritual community where users can build profiles, follow each other, exchange direct messages, receive notifications, and engage with a community feed. The platform will maintain the cosmic aesthetic and spiritual focus while providing modern social networking capabilities.
